Title: N-Queens Problem using Backtracking
Contributor: https://github.com/Nitin-0017

Description:
1. The N-Queens problem is a classic backtracking problem where we must place
   N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
2. This means:
      - No two queens share the same row.
      - No two queens share the same column.
      - No two queens share the same diagonal.
3. We use recursion and backtracking to explore all valid placements.
4. The algorithm places a queen in each row and recursively checks for safety.
5. If a placement leads to a conflict, we backtrack and try a new position.

Example Output (for n = 4):

Solving 4-Queens Problem:

Placed Q at (0, 1)
Placed Q at (1, 3)
Placed Q at (2, 0)
Placed Q at (3, 2)
Removed Q from (3, 2) (backtrack)
Removed Q from (2, 0) (backtrack)
... etc

All possible solutions:

Solution 1:
.Q..
...Q
Q...
..Q.

Solution 2:
..Q.
Q...
...Q
.Q..

Advantages:
1. Demonstrates recursion and backtracking clearly.
2. Efficiently finds all valid configurations for N queens.
3. Excellent for understanding constraint satisfaction problems.

Disadvantages:
1. Computationally expensive for large N (exponential time).
2. Requires careful handling of recursive calls and backtracking.
